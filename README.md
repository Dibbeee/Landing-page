# Landing-page

In this project I have realized how much I have learned over the course of a few hours put into flexbox.

I am very happy with myself that I "copied" what the project was supposed to look like. I also did it without peeking at someone else's finished project, there were some things that I wanted to do that I didn't remeber so i googled it but thats as far as "peeking" i did.

This far Flexbox has for sure been the most fun and exciting part abourt web development. Before I started TOP I had no idea that flexbox even existed and now I know how to use it, yeyyyyyyy :)

I am excited for what comes up next with JavaScript but I am also pretty scared because it is what I think will be the most challenging thing for me about this course, but I will still chugg through it though.
